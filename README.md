## Federation

Ditto is primarily a Nostr client, using a Nostr relay as its database. ActivityPub objects are translated into Nostr events in realtime and cached by the Ditto server. When you submit a post, it sends it to your Nostr relay and then fans it out to the ActivityPub network.

The main way to use Ditto is with a Mastodon app. Or you can connect directly to the Nostr relay with a Nostr client.
